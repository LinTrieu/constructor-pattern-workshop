# Encapsulation with the constructor and prototype pattern (1.5 hours)

### Learning objectives

1. Describe what a constructor function does.  Describe what a constructor function's prototype does.
2. Write a constructor function and prototype to encapsulate some behaviour.
3. Explain the strengths and weaknesses of the constructor and prototype pattern as a way to encapsulate behaviour.

### Starter (15 minutes)

* Do "thumbs" on the learning objectives.

* Talk about the high level goal of the week (see the [student README](README.md)).

* Show the CountModel code.  [Easy to read version without workshop-related comments](https://github.com/maryrosecook/count/blob/master/public/js/countModel.js).  Run the code and explain at a high level how it works.

* Demonstrate getting visibility to answer a couple of the questions in the [student README](README.md).

* Do "thumbs" on the learning objectives.

### Main: investigate pattern (30 minutes)

See the [student readme](README.md) for instructions.

### Main: implement pattern (25 minutes)

See the [student readme](README.md) for instructions.

### Plenary (20 minutes)

* Collaboratively review students' implementation of the user stories.

* Ask the students about the strengths and weaknesses of the constructor and prototype pattern as a way of encapsulating behaviour.

* Do "thumbs" on the learning objectives.
